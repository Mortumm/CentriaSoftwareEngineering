        <h1>Reflection on the task:</h1>
        <p><b>Which CSS method is easiest to use?</b></p>
        <p>
            I think it is safer, easier and clearer to manage page styling in a
            individual file, althought quick tests for visual effects are
            quicker to test on the HTML blocks themselves.
        </p>
        <p><b>Which method is best for large projects?</b></p>
        <p>
            Would prefer individual CSS files for anything larger than a single
            page site. Styling would become more than cumbersome for multipage
            sites very quickly.
        </p>
        <p><b>What are the pros and cons of each?</b></p>
        <p>
            Would differentiate the methods by how one should do things properly
            and what is something that you can use to test immediate effects on
            the fly and then transfer the styling to its _actual home_ in the
            .css file.
